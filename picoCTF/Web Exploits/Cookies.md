**Problem Statement:** Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. `http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/`

**Solution:** Something about cooookies...Well on using the placeholder as the cookie name, we can see that it takes us to `/check` webpage. Now, the cookie is set `name=1`, so I changed the values to 2 and it was some other cookies name on the webpage.. Thus we need to iterate over the numbers...I added 5 to my initial values and realized there are around 29 cookies.. then iterate over all the 29 cookies where i found the flag on `17th`

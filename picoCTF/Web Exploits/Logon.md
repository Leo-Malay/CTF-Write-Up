# Logon

**Tags:** `Easy`,`Web Exploitation`

**Problem Statement:** The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44573/`

**Solution:** We are given the username `Joe`, however upon logon, it makes a GET request to `/flag` page and the cookies has a value, `admin: False`. I tried changing the value to `True` and got the flag.

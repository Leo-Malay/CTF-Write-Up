# Manual Labour

**Problem Statement:** I went looking for the oldest computer I could find for this challenge, and it was still too fast! The only reasonable solution was to do the math myself! Please be patient when submitting answers. It takes me a sec to count all the right characters by hand.

**Approach:** Basically if you get the first char of password correct then the response is delayed by 0.5s and if you get 2 then 1s ans so on... So write a script and hope you get it in half hour or more.. This challange is a non-deterministic challenge. Sicne your outcome is dependent on how many people are working towards solving it.

**Solution:** `CSGgtiimn`

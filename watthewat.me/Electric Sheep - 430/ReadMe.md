# Electric Sheep - 430

**Problem Statement:** I'm hosting an art gallery in a few weeks, and asked AI to draw me a picture. I wanted it to be full of emotion - raw human emotion. It definitely gave me a picture, but I'm not sure about the "human" emotion part. Can you figure out what it was trying to tell me? Maybe there's more to a robot's soul...

**URL:** [https://ai.watthewat.me/](https://ai.watthewat.me/)

**Approach:** Upon inspecting the code, I quickly realized that there is a canvas and the drawing script is actually commented.

**Solution:** Copy the whole code and run it in an online HTML preview and uncomment it.
